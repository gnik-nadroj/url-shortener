# URL Shortener

A simple and fast URL shortener service written in Go.

## Features

- Exposes a REST API with two endpoints: /shortener and /stats
- Uses a base62 encoder to generate short URLs from an incremental index
- Stores data in a Redis database with key-value pairs and lists
- Tracks the number of clicks for each shortened URL

## Architecture
![alt text](https://github.com/gnik-nadroj/url-shortener/blob/main/assets/arch.png?raw=true)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Go and Redis installed on your system.

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/gnik-nadroj/url-shortener`
- Change directory to the project folder: `cd url-shortener`
- Deploy: `docker-compose up` 
- The server will listen on `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

The API has two endpoints: /shortener and /stats.

### /shortener

This endpoint accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing the original URL to be shortened. For example:

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.google.com"
}
```
The response will be a JSON object with the shortened URL and the original URL. For example:

```json
{
  "shortURL": "http://localhost:8080/4fRg3"
}
```

The shortened URL will have at least 5 characters, and will be generated by adding the value of 62^4 to the current index of the shortened URLs, and then converting it to base62. For example, if the current index is 123, the shortened URL will be 62^4 + 123 = 14776351, and then base62(14776351) = 4fRg3.

### /stats
This endpoint accepts a GET request and returns a JSON array with all the shortened URLs and their corresponding original URLs and click counts. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "shortURL": "http://localhost:8080/4fRg3",
    "clicks": 12
  },
  {
    "shortURL": "http://localhost:8080/6tUx8",
    "clicks": 7
  },
  {
    "shortURL": "http://localhost:8080/9aFb2",
    "clicks": 3
  }
]
```
The click count for each shortened URL is incremented every time the short URL is visited and redirected to the original URL.
